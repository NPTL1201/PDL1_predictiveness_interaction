# This analysis is based on R.
# the input object data is a data.frame. 
# Rows are patients' ids.
# Columns include information about survival, PD-L1 expression, and tested gene expression.
# a is the position of the column that contains the beginning of the tested gene expression data.
# b is the position of the column that contains the ending of the tested gene expression data.
# c is the position of the column that contains the PD-L1 expression data.
